It works in Node.js and the browser (using a bundler).

Emitting events asynchronously is important for production code where you want the least amount of synchronous operations. Since JavaScript is single-threaded, no other code can run while doing synchronous operations. For Node.js, that means it will block other requests, defeating the strength of the platform, which is scalability through async. In the browser, a synchronous operation could potentially cause lags and block user interaction.

## Install

```
$ npm install emittery
```

## Usage

```js
const Emittery = require('emittery');

const emitter = new Emittery();

emitter.on('ğŸ¦„', data => {
	console.log(data);
});

const myUnicorn = Symbol('ğŸ¦„');

emitter.on(myUnicorn, data => {
	console.log(`Unicorns love ${data}`);
});

emitter.emit('ğŸ¦„', 'ğŸŒˆ'); // Will trigger printing 'ğŸŒˆ'
emitter.emit(myUnicorn, 'ğŸ¦‹');  // Will trigger printing 'Unicorns love ğŸ¦‹'
```

## API

### eventName

Emittery accepts strings and symbols as event names.

Symbol event names can be used to avoid name collisions when your classes are extended, especially for internal events.

### emitter = new Emittery()

#### on(eventName | eventName[], li
